1.Create the "department" database:
use department;

2.Create the "teacher" collection with fields as name, department, experience, and salary:
db.createCollection("teacher");

Insert sample documents into the "teacher" collection:
db.teacher.insertMany([
  { name: "Teacher1", department: "Mathematics", experience: 5, salary: 60000 },
  { name: "Teacher2", department: "Computer Science", experience: 8, salary: 75000 },
  { name: "Teacher3", department: "Mathematics", experience: 3, salary: 55000 },
  { name: "Teacher4", department: "Computer Science", experience: 7, salary: 70000 },
  { name: "Teacher5", department: "Physics", experience: 6, salary: 62000 },
]);



3.Display the department-wise average salary:
db.teacher.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$department",
      avgSalary: { $avg: "$salary" }
    }
  }
]);

4.Display the number of employees working in each department:
db.teacher.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$department",
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  }
]);


5.Display the department-wise minimum salary:
db.teacher.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$department",
      minSalary: { $min: "$salary" }
    }
  }
]);

6.Apply an index on a specific field (e.g., department):
db.teacher.createIndex({ department: 1 });

Drop the index:
db.teacher.dropIndex("department_1");
