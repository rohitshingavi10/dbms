i. Modify the database so that a particular company (e.g., ABC) is now in Pune:
UPDATE Company
SET city = 'Pune'
WHERE cname = 'ABC';

ii. Give all managers of Mbank a 10% raise. If salary is >20,000, give only a 3% raise:
UPDATE Manager
SET salary = CASE
    WHEN mgrname = 'Mbank' AND salary <= 20000 THEN salary * 1.1
    WHEN mgrname = 'Mbank' AND salary > 20000 THEN salary * 1.03
    ELSE salary
END;

iii. Find out the names of all the employees who work in the 'Bosch' company in the city 'Pune':
SELECT e.ename
FROM Emp e
INNER JOIN works w ON e.emp_id = w.emp_id
INNER JOIN Company c ON w.c_id = c.c_id
WHERE c.cname = 'Bosch' AND c.city = 'Pune';

iv. Delete all records in the works table for employees of a particular company (e.g., 'SBC Company') whose salary > 50,000:

DELETE FROM works
WHERE c_id = (SELECT c_id FROM Company WHERE cname = 'SBC Company')
AND sal > 50000;
